Notes on Observer Method:

* Observer pattern establishes a one to many relationships between a subject and multiple observers.

* Problem: 
	- Subject object should be monitored.
	- Observer obejcts should be notified about any changes in the subject.

* Scenario:
	- Core temperatures monitored using sensores in reactor plants.
	- So that, whenever changes in temperatures will be notified to registered observers using notifications.

* Solution:
	- We need an abstract class called Subject, which has interfaces for attaching, detatching and 
	  Notifying Observers.
	- We also need concrete subject class inheriting from the abstract subject class.

* Singleton is related to the Obsevrer design pattern.
