* Other than simply using design patterns, there are also univerala principles we need to be applying 
  whenever we are coding.

* Consistency is one of the hall mark of a good software engineering.

* One of the reasons why we recommned the design patterns is to promote the consistency of the code.

* If the same solution is used over and over agian to solve the same problem, we just need to modify
  only small piece of code when there is a need for change of code. Otherwise, we need to frame differnet 
  strategies for different solutions to accomodate the change.

* Benefits of consistency:
- Decrease in committing errors: since the sam epiece of code is used over and over again.
- Increase in detecting errors: since more sets of eyes look at the same code.
- Cost savings in software development: since we need to reuse well established the design solutions in
  the form of design patterns, in-house or third party implementations.

- Software architecture(by use of design patterns) helps in scaling up of the software.
- Another, measure of acheiving consistency is by us of: Frameworks.
- A frameworks is a set of design pattern put together in a specific passion to accomplish a specific goal.
- for example. there are framweoks for Software Security, for Web based business like E-commerce.

- therefore, consistency is very imp and design pattern helps doing it.
