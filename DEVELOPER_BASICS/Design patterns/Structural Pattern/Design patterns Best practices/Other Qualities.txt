* The use of design patterns also promote the ideal qualities of software 
  such as completeness and correctness.
* Completeness and Correctness:	 
  - Completeness - how much of what is required
  - Correctness - correct results by software

* Coupling and Cohesion:
  - Coupling: tightly bounded software components, which have dependency on other functionality 
              in other component.
  - Cohesion: the indepence among software components.
  - Its recommended for less coupling and more cohesion in software architecture.
