Notes on Proxy Method:

* Proxy becomes handy when creating an object that is resource intensive.

* Problem: 
  - Postpone object creation as long as possible due to resource intensiveness of object we ar creating.
  - Therefore, We need to have a placeholder that will indicate need for object creation at that 
    point of time.

* Scenario:
  - Producer( Resource ) - handling objects, waiting for Guests.
  - Artists( Proxy )- waiting for Producer, will be checking for free time of producer.
  - Guests - consulted by Producer.

* Solution:
  - Clients - Interacting with Proxy object most of the time untill resource intensive object is availble.
  - Proxy - Waiting for creating the resource intensive objects

* Adapter & Decorator are related to the proxy design pattern.
