* When we have items in a hierarchical order(following tree structure), then we can apply Composite design 
pattern.

* He we declare one top class. then we declare childs to add it to.

* later, we declare super top class to hold above items.

* i,e. first children were added to some parent node. Later, we can add the root and add up these children.
