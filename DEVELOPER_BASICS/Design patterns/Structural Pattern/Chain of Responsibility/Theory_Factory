Notes on Chain of Responsibility Method:

* Chain of responsibilty opens a various possiblity of processing a given request.

* The chain of responsibility pattern de-couples the request and the processing.

* Problem:
	- Many different processing needs to be done depending on the request type.

* Scenario:
	- We use many different integers. and handlers to find the range of integer.

* Solution:
	Abstract Handler: handles request if its not handled.
	Concrete Handler: checks whether request came is handles or not. if not, handles it and returns status code.
