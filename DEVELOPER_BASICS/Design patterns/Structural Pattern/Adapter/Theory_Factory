Notes on Adapter Method:

* Adapter converts an interface of a class into another one, which the client is expceting.

* Problem:
  - Interfaces are incompatible between a client and a server (Incompatible interfaces)

* Scenario:
  - Korean():
		speak_korean()
  - British():
		speak_british()

   but,
  - client : speak()

* Our solution is to use the Adapter pattern, that translates the method name in between the client and server.

* Bridges and decorators are related to the pattern.
