Notes on Proxy Method:

* Consder Its expensive to create an instance of an object since it will take huge resources to instiate it.

* So, we have to make sure that each time we try to instantiate/call it, we are calling only when it can
  listening to our commands/arguments. Else, we have to simply dont call and waste system resources.

* Then, in such cases, proxy design pattern helps out.

* It acts as a Middle man between Caller and Producer. It ensures if Producer is idle, and instantiates 
  Producer. Else, It will make us to wait untill Producer becomes idle.

* Decorator, Proxy and Adapter can be closely related.
