Notes on Visitor Method:

* This pattern allows adding new features to an existing class hierarchy, without changing it.

* Problem:
	- It is some times neccessary to add new functions dynamically to an existing classes 
	   with minimal changes.

* Scenario:
	- House class: Some bathroom repair in a house
	- Visitor in this Scenario: a Plumber or Electrican.

* Solution:
	- Visitor pattern represents new operations to perform on an existing class hierarchy.
	- Visitors can also provide operations on a composite object.
