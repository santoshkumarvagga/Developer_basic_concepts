Notes on Bridge Method:

* The bridge method untangles an unncessary complicated hierarchy, especially when 
  implementation-specific classes are mixed together with implementation-independent classes.

* Problem:
  - Two unrelated, parallel, or orthogonal abstractions.

  - One is Implementation specific

  - The other one is Implementation independent.

* Scenario:
  - Implementation independent circle abstraction(involves how to give properties to a circle)
  - Implementation dependent circle abstraction (invloves how to draw a circle)

* Solution:
  - Not trting to put both Implementation dependent and Implementation specific classes under a single 
    class hierarchy

* The abstract factory and adapter factory are the related patterns to this rich design pattern.
