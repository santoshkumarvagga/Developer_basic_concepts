* Consider we are running a pets shop.

* Currently, we sell only Dogs.

* In future, we are planning to sell Cats too.

* But, the client is supposed to call for a pet using only one common method, get_pet().

* Client may call for Dogs or for Cats. But as a reply, he should get the Barking sound of the pet.
