Notes on Prototype Method:

* When we need multiple similar objects but with slight modifications(if any), then we should create a
  Prototype which can be set as refernce, to take from.

* It is expensive to create a whole new class each time, hence we can clone the existing class and make 
changes to the members.

* Scenario:
   - Mass production

* Solution:
   - Create a prototypical instance first
   - Simply clone it whenever you need replica
