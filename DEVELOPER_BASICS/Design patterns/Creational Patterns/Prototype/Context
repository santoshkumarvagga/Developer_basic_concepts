* Consider a Mass car production company

* It has to make 100 cars of same model

* Its expensive for it to design new models each time and its useless when we can refer existing ones.

* So, better solution could be first design a model and bring out a sample working piece.

* if it meets all requirements, then use the existing template to manufacture other 99 cars.

* If any need to alter options for some cars, then either change/modify proprties of the exisitng model and 
  make it out.
