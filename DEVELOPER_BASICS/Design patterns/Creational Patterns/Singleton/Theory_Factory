* We need to initiate a class only once so that it acts as a Global reference for other 
  components which can use it as a information cache.

* Any further object creation should refer to same shared global attribute.

* Modules in python are best examples of singletons

* hence, singletons are best way to create a global attribute to be shared as a 
  reference for all other interacting software components.
