Notes on Factory Method:

* Creational Pattern

* Provides one of the bet way to create objects w/o actually exposing logic to client and referring to 
  newly created object via a common interface called factory method

* Which object is created is decided based upon the string that we pass

* Internally, in factory method, the passed strings are mapped to the corresponding objects & by w hich 
  the so created objevt is returned.

* Customer actually calls factory method with varying strings like 'cat', 'dog'. 
  but factory method handles the request and returns the requested object. and hence the name Factory.

* Once returned, we can do operations like as we perform on any other objects

* Factory method helps in returning corresponding objects if we are unsure about 
  the kind of objects/class we need at point of time in future.

* NOTE: Care should be taken that all the class objects are instatiated inside factory method with their arguments, if any.
